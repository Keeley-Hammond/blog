Happy Monday!

We're into April now, and our 401 class starts today. Very excited to start taking a deeper dive into Node and server-side development - most of this weekend was spent reading about TDD and modules.export.

More exciting news: near the end of next month, [I’m hosting an evening Intro to Git and GitHub class for Women Who Code Portland](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Portland/events/239020608/), as part of our Beginner's Guide to Open Source series. I can’t wait to help some awesome women make their first pull requests!

### Articles

Here are a few articles I’ve enjoyed over the past week — give yourself a little mental boost on your Monday morning:

* [James Sinclair's intro to TDD with Javascript comes with a great step-by-step tutorial for unit testing and test driven development.](http://jrsinclair.com/articles/2016/gentle-introduction-to-javascript-tdd-intro/)
* [Designing a RESTful API with Node](https://dev.to/raha198/restful-api-design-with-nodejs)
* Big fan of JS Party on the Changlog, and particularly enjoyed this discussion on how AMP works and framework fatigue in JS: [JavaScript Fatigue, AMP, and Paths.js](https://changelog.com/jsparty/3)
* [As a long-time Ohioan, apparently I've been eating food wrong for years.](https://twitter.com/broderick/status/851160598813569025)

Have a great week, everybody!
