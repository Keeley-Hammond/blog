Happy Monday! Hope you all had a nice weekend. Portland was horribly rainy this weekend, so there was a lot of spending time indoors and cleaning. I think I've got about 5 lbs of fresh laundry folded in the living room.

Dave and I did manage to sneak out to Starvation Ridge on Sunday afternoon, and got a lovely view for it:

### Articles

Here are a few articles I’ve enjoyed over the past week — give yourself a little mental boost on your Monday morning:

* [Listened to old JS Party podcasts on my long run and loved this one about Glitch.](https://changelog.com/jsparty/2) I've been hearing a lot about Glitch, but I think Jenn Schiffer has the best explanation of what it is and what you can do with it. I built a little Node TwitterBot over the weekend with it!
* Claire Pollard wrote a great article about caring for yourself while coding over, and the tools that you can use to help step back: [Coding with Care.](https://dev.to/thetuftii/coding-with-care) The Tiny Care Terminal is adorable; I downloaded it and started using it this weekend. One of my teachers is a big fan of the Pomodoro method, and I think this foils nicely with it.
* Not an article, but AlterConf Portland has just started selling tickets! I'm extremely grateful to Ashe Dryden and AlterConf - I won my scholarship to Code Fellows at AlterConf last year. If you're in Portland, please attend and support: [AlterConf Tickets and Event Info](https://alterconf.com/conferences/portland-or-2017)
* Big fan of JS Party on the Changlog, and particularly enjoyed this discussion on Mastodon (the service) and Node bots: [VM Neutrality in Node.js (N-API), Learning JavaScript, and Mastodon](https://changelog.com/jsparty/7)


Have a great week, everybody!
