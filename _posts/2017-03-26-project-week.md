It's Final Project Week for the intermediate Javascript course; it feels as though the time is passing very quickly. My team and I are being asked to complete a project with the following requirements:

* It must have at least three separate pages, with information persisting between the pages.
* It must use at least one API.
* It must use a database (this is a stretch goal, but I really love working with Node and the Postgres database, so I'm politely pushing us to take it on).
* It must have a mobile-first design with media queries.

We created a site for Chinese tea enthusiasts, called GongFuChaTea.org. *Gong fu cha* is a Chinese term, *gong fu* meaning the art of practicing and doing something well, and *cha* meaning tea - in this case, a Chinese tea ritual and appreciation for good Chinese, Taiwanese and Japanese teas.
