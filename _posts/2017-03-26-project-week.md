It's Final Project Week for the intermediate Javascript course; it feels as though the time is passing very quickly. My team and I are being asked to complete a project with the following requirements:

* It must have at least three separate pages, with information persisting between the pages.
* It must use at least one API.
* It must use a database (this is a stretch goal, but I really love working with Node and the Postgres database, so I'm politely pushing us to take it on).
* It must have a mobile-first design with media queries.

We created a site for Chinese tea enthusiasts, called GongFuChaTea.org. *Gong fu cha* is a Chinese term, *gong fu* meaning the art of practicing and doing something well, and *cha* meaning tea - in this case, a Chinese tea ritual and appreciation for good Chinese, Taiwanese and Japanese teas. One of our members runs a Facebook group with members in multiple continents, and he had hoped to create this as a database and networking site for his community to use. To summarize the group's purpose:

> This website is an extension of the Gong Fu Cha Facebook group, an international social network of tea enthusiasts. The purpose of this website is to celebrate, spread, develop, and illuminate the rich culture and activity that is Gong Fu Cha 功夫茶. We provide a way to find tea shops, tea houses, tea events, and other points of interests through a user generated tea map. We also facilitate finding information on the what, where, why, when, and how of Gong Fu Cha for people both new and experienced.

## Favorite Challenges

### Google Maps API
* Synchronizing address formats to accomodate China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Spain
* Using Maps vs Places API to find relevant store information
* 

## Postgres DB
I've really enjoyed working with Node and writing the ajax calls and traces needed to communicate between the client and server. Using a database for our actual project was a stretch goal, as SQL and Heroku's DB add-ons weren't something that we really covered in class. However, I really wanted to try it and my teammates (all smart, curious and good sports) were very game.



### Mobile Design
Designing with "mobile first" in mind seems incredibly smart and snappy - until you remember that you're using the desktop view as your default for tests, and that all of the painstaking CSS work you just completed was all for the desktop.
