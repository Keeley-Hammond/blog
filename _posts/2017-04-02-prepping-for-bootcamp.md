header: What To Do Before Your Coding Bootcamp

Since starting at Code Fellows, I've done fairly well in the course work. I've finished at the top of my class for not one, but two consecutive months in a row, and that's not something I take lightly - we have a lot of talented people in the course.

My classmates and I have spoken a lot about the things that we'd wish we'd known before coming to the bootcamp, and specifically, the things that we wish we'd done. While it's fresh in my mind, I want to put down a few thoughts about ome concrete things that you can do to prepare for your code bootcamp, if it's something you're thinking of doing:

## What to Expect
A lot of coding bootcamps that I researched (including Code Fellows) promise to take students from zero to software engineer in about four months. Frankly, I think that's nonsense and I'm going to emphasize this as much as I can:

**Do not come into a coding bootcamp if you have never coded before.**

Just don't do it - full stop. Yes, maybe you'll be a natural wizard and just get everything easily. But more than likely? You're going to struggle like hell. Many of the people who struggled the most in our cohort were the foks who had little to no coding experience. If you're going to drop a stack of cash and made the emotional decision to switch careers, it seems like a no brainer to make sure that you like coding first.

With that being said, you certainly don't have to be an expert before you enroll. But based on my experience, hitting these four benchmarks would be a good start:

## How to Prepare
### 1. Learn Git and GitHub
As a developer, you're going to be using git - a lot. Having a base into what git is, how it works and where you can store your code repositories (with GitHub being the nost common and popular option) will help you.

Here are a few places where you can find a good overview of git:

* [Git: A simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
* [GitHub: Intro to Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

I'd also highly recommend [opening a GitHub account](https://github.com/) and poking around - it's free.

### 2. Build a website, even (and especially if) it's a crappy one.
Having a rough knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript will be incredibly helpful to you, It doesn't have to be a good website - and it shouldn't be, it's your first site! - but you should be able to create it and have a rough understanding of how things work.

Some of my favorite resources for this:
* [Treehouse: How to Make a Website](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/how-to-make-a-website)
* [Code Academy: Intro to HTML and CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web)
* [General Assembly: Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/)

I'd really recommend building and maintaining a personal site or blog, to help you understand how things like DNS providers work. Build one in Wordpress to start! Or build a static site and host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), now that you have a GitHub account that you're using. I built a Wordpress site for my company at the time back in 2012, and had a running site through Wordpress until I crafted a new static site this year. You don't need to know everything and it doesn't need to be perfect; the important thing is the practice.

### 3. Write down your goals.

This is going to seem like the fluffiest prep item, and the one that's easiest to ignore. Don't.

Coming to Code Fellows is one of the best decisions that I've ever made. But it's important to come in with clear eyes; do your prep work and you'll find your bootcamp experience will be a heck of a lot more managable.
