Happy Monday! Hope you all had a delightful Easter and/or Pesach  - or just a nice weekend.

I had a very nice weekend spent debugging some asynch issues for the open source tea website that I'm a maintainer for (along with my awesome co-maintainers, Nicky and Yuval).

I also went for a long hike on Sunday, ending with some beers at pFriem:

Anyway, let's get down to what's going on this week:

### Events

If you're in PDX tech:
* [Tues, 4/18: Donut.js April Meetup @ 6:00p!](https://donutjs.club/) DonutJS had some great speakers this week; hit up me or Women Who Code PDX if you want a ticket.
* [Thurs, 4/20: React JS Study Night with Women Who Code.](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Portland/events/239177382/) Shae, who runs the study night, is awesome and will walk you through a React component tutorial.
* [Tues, 4/25: Intro to Git and GitHub](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Portland/events/239020608/) I’m hosting an evening Intro to Git and GitHub class for Women Who Code Portland, taught by Scott Hanselman and Grace Andrews as part of our Beginner's Guide to Open Source series. I can’t wait to help some awesome people make their first pull requests.

### Non-Tech Events: 

* [Portland Running Company has an awesome Thirsty Thursday 4-6 mile run @ 6:00p](https://www.meetup.com/Portland-Running-Co-Weekly-Group-Runs/events/238871360/), led by Mark Remy. Come run with us; the first round of beers is on Rogue.

### Articles

Here are a few articles I’ve enjoyed over the past week — give yourself a little mental boost on your Monday morning:

* [Listened to this week's Changelog and heard about Kent C Dodd's awesome "First Timer's Only" open source guide.](https://medium.com/@kentcdodds/first-timers-only-78281ea47455) It's an oldie, but a goodie. He created easy PRs and marked them "first timers only", encouraging new coders to contribute.
* Slack Engineering wr0te up a good explanation of Typescript and how/why they're using it: [TypeScript at Slack.](https://slack.engineering/typescript-at-slack-a81307fa288d) I didn't realize that Slack was almost entirely Javascript-based.
* Big fan of JS Party on the Changlog, and particularly enjoyed this discussion on Mastodon (the service) and Node bots: [VM Neutrality in Node.js (N-API), Learning JavaScript, and Mastodon](https://changelog.com/jsparty/7)
* Not an article, but I really like watching Suz Hilton's Node livestreams, where she codes in real time. Here's her latest one from Sunday: [NoopKat, Experimenting with the Fitbit API](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/136030831)


Have a great week, everybody!
