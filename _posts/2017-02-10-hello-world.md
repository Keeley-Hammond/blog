We recently finished our final project for Code 201, the beginner Javascript class for Code Fellows PDX. During the project, we ran into an awesome challenge and one that made me very excited: closures.

I'm sure most people already know what closures are and how they work, but for a beginner, it was an eye-opening experience to use them in the wild.
