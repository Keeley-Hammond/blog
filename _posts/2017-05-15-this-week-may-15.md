Hello, and happy Monday! We had a bizarre weekend of sunshine, rain, hail and apocalyptic wind, depending on what hour you were outside. Here's hoping everyone stayed dry.

Here's what's going on in Portland this week:

### Articles

Here are a few articles, podcasts and assorted things that I’ve enjoyed over the past week — give yourself a little mental boost on your Monday morning:

* It's project week here at Code Fellows, and I want to give a shout out to the [Spotify API, which has incredible documentation and detailed tutorials for setting up authorization routes.](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) If you're looking for a good API to play with, I highly recommend using Spotify.
* After our binary exploitation workshop last weekend, reading Antoinette Maria's article on [her first Capture the Flag security competition was a treat.](https://dev.to/_theycallmetoni/capture-the-flag-its-a-game-for-hacki-mean-security-professionals) The CTF rounds sound incredibly fun, and I love the examples that she gives for us to try.
* I've been working with MongoDB and Mongoose quite a bit lately, and enjoyed [Talk Python's episode on MongoDB applied design patterns.](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/109/mongodb-applied-design-patterns) Some of the techniques that Rick Copeland discusses were helpful when designing our database in mLab this week.
* A quick bump for [AlterConf Portland, which has just started selling tickets.](https://alterconf.com/conferences/portland-or-2017) I'm extremely grateful to Ashe Dryden and AlterConf - I won my scholarship to Code Fellows at AlterConf last year. If you're in Portland, please attend and support:
